    <H2 class="who">WHO recommends the following set of measurements to prevent person-person spread of
        COVID-19:</H2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>
 Limit close contact between infectious people and others. Ensure a physical distance of at
    least 1 meter from others. In areas where COVID-19 is circulating and this distance
    cannot be guaranteed, wear a mask.
</li>
<li>
Identify infected people quickly so that they can be isolated and cared for and all of their
close contacts can be quarantined in appropriate facilities.
</li>
<li>
Clean hands and cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or bent elbow at all times.
</li>
<li>
Avoid crowded places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces with poor
ventilation. 
</li>
<li>
Ensure good ventilation in indoor settings, including homes and offices.
</li>
<li>
Stay home if feeling unwell and call your medical provider as soon as possible to
determine whether medical care is needed.
</li>
<li>
In countries or areas where COVID-19 is circulating, health workers should use medical
masks continuously during all routine activities in clinical areas in health care facilities. 
</li>
<li>
Health workers should also use additional personal protective equipment and precautions
when caring for COVID-19 patients.
</li>
<li>
Workplaces should have in place protective measures.
