          The coronavirus pandemic of 2019â€“2021 is profoundly changing life as we know it on a worldwide scale. COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus 2 that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). It was initially noticed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, when an epidemic was discovered. The World Health Organization declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020, after over three months of considerable continuous spread in various nations around the world.
      
       
          As of September 4, 2021, about 219 million instances of COVID-19 had been recorded in over 210 countries across the globe, resulting in approximately 4.5 million deaths

            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors, Health-care Workers and Fight against COVID-19:</h2>
            <p class="p2" style="margin: 30px; line-height:1.0cm;">
                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease.
                <br>
                Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.
                <br>
                Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. Most importantly, we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us. Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology. Nothing will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than this.
